# Milestone Project 3 | Book Club

## Scalable Architecture

One package per functionality. We can now simply add more packages as needed.
Packages are also available to be reused as needed. Each package is self sufficient.
You can plug in these packages into other python applications if wanted to reuse
again in another project.
